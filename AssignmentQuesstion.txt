2. List down Data Types in Java (with wrapper class name, memory size,range) in a tabular format.

byte	 Byte	 1 Byte		 	128 to -128
short 	 Short 	 2 Bytes			32767 to -32768
int 	 Int   	 4 Bytes			2147483647 to -2147483648
long	 Long 	 8 Bytes

float 	 Float 	  4 Bytes			1.4E-45
double 	 Double 	  8 Bytes			3.4028235E38

char 	 Character   2 Bytes			'A' 'C'
string 	 String 	   Uses two Bytes		
		   per character as per the 	"Sherwin"
		   value given in a string 	
						
boolean 	 Boolean	   1 Bit			0 or 1

3. Write examples for increment and decrement operators

    a = 5; 		o/p:- a = 6;
    b= a++;                  o/p:- b = 5
       
   int a = 6; 	o/p:- a = 5
   int b = --a;	        b = 5  

   int a = 10;	o/p:- a = 9
   int b = a--;	         b = 10;

   int a = 20;                o/p:- a = 19;
   int b = ++a;              0/p: b = 19;

5. Write the concepts discussed about strings in the class.

   1) Strings are not a Primitive Data Type in java.
    2) The String data is stored in heap memory.
    3) String variable stores the memory location

=====================================================
6. Research and write what is String pool in java.

         String pool is nothing but storage area in java heap where string literals stores.
         By default it is empty and privately maintained by the java String class.
         Whenever we create a string the string object occupies some space in the heap memory.
         To decrease the number of String objects created in the JVM the String class keeps a pool of strings.
         When we create a string literal, the JVM first check that literal in the String pool. If the literal is already present in the pool, it returns a reference to the pooled instance. If the literal is not present in the pool, a new String object takes place in the String pool.
